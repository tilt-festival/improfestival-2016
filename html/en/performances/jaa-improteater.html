We have become targeted numbers within the system. The world has changed a lot and this change will only continue. But humans are still the same, They have needs, desires, hopes and dreams and within all this machinery and data all they really want is just to have real human contact.</p><hr><p>Jaa !mprov theatre has brought good short- and long-form improvisation to the audience for more than seven seasons. Our goal is to offer ways of connecting with stage either through laughter, acknowledgment or viewpoints that you wouldn’t expect. Everything that happens on the stage is improvised, every performance is unique and it all depends on you - the good audience!<br></p><ul><li><a href="http://jaa.ee" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">jaa.ee</a></li><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/jaaimproteater" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">facebook.com/jaaimproteater</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></body></html>
