Because these participants are very skillful improvisers, they are happy to engage also in challenges that are bigger than just improvising a performance on the spot! The same morning brave improvisers form different groups have met in the workshop of an improviser from the Réunion island Keng-Sam Chane Chick Té, with whom they have prepared the format that you will see in the evening. How will it all turn out - come see at the performance!</p></div></div></div></div></body></html>
