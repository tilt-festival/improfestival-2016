Time travel was never more fun as we explore paradox, the future, present and the past. Internet, anyone? Cellphones? Hoverboard parking at owners own risk.</p><hr><p>Peter, Jochem and Nicole are the original founders of easylaughs in Amsterdam, even pre-dating easylaughs by founding Problem Solved first. They have been improvising together in one group or another for more than 15 years. All three of them are known on the International improvisation scene, performing and teaching in festivals across Europe. Peter and Nicole have been performing as a comedy duo (Mischler &amp; More) and Jochem and Peter have been performing as a comedy duo (Dizzy). Now they have combined duos to make a comedy trio.<br></p><ul><li><a href="http://www.mischlerandmore.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">mischlerandmore.com</a></li><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/MischlerMore/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">facebook.com/MischlerMore</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></body></html>
