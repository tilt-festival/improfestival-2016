Like it is appropriate in an improvised play, the structure is decided by the audience.<br> The staging will take the audience and actors on more serious paths. Every person has to deal with death in their lifetime. The improvised play will start with funerals but then we will have the possibility to take part and watch the life of the deceased. In the focus of the story is a person’s life with its twists and turns.</p><hr><p>Improv theatre IMPEERIUM (Empire) originated from the first professional improv group in Estonia in 2014. Even though IMPEERIUM is still young, its actors already have seven years of experience with improv. The members of the group are all professional actors, who in addition to being members of IMPEERIUM, are also part of drama troups in other Estonian theatres or work as freelancers in various theater, television and film projects. In addition to actors, there are also talented musicians and lightning designers in the group, who all help to spread love for improv all across Estonia.<br> The Imperials entertain audience with two-act performances, create excitement at preordered shows and arise fantasy in improv workshops. In improv nobody knows what is going to happen, but everything is possible! And that is one of the reasons why the group loves improv in all it’s shapes and forms. <br></p><ul><li><a href="http://www.improimpeerium.ee" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">improimpeerium.ee</a></li><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/improimpeerium" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">facebook.com/improimpeerium</a></li><li><a href="https://www.instagram.com/improteater_impeerium" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">instagram.com/improteater_impeerium</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></body></html>
