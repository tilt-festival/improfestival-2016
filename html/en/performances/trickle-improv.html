In the beginning of the show the performers generate a title for their play together with the audience. Five audience members are then randomly selected and receive a coloured pillow which they can throw on the stage whenever they want (but only once) during the play. These pillows will influence the current scene significantly making the actors change the pace of the story. Come see - if you can throw them off balance!</p><hr><p>Trickle Improv is a Belgian theatre duo, that brings improvised plays to the stage, usually with an unknown guest performer. The company was founded in 2013 and an endless series of bi-weekly performances across multiple theatres in Belgium started soon after. With shows in Dutch and English Trickle uniquely appeals to a larger audience community in Belgium.<br> Unique is that for every single show, they invite a brand new guest performer. Their guest list has quickly encompassed prominent members of the Belgian, Dutch, and later the wider European improv community and it hasn’t taken long for them to partake also in the European improv festivals as teachers and performers.<br></p><ul><li><a href="http://trickle-improv.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">trickle-improv.com</a></li><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/trickleimprov" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">facebook.com/trickleimprov</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></body></html>
