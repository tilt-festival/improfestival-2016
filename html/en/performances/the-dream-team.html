Somehow all the improvisers seem to know them and want to share a talk over a beer with them so they’re never left alone. They are the Dream Team! A performance that is brought to you by the people that have been the teachers of this years festival. They come from very different parts of world but are connected by deep love towards improv and knowledge they’ve been gathering in years on stage and in workshops. This is a mixture of improv characters, techniques and ideas from different cultures that will come together for only one time. And this is the last performance of Tilt 2016. So - This is it!</p><p>On the stage: Kaisa Kokko (FIN), Nicole Mischler (NLD), Hila Di Castro (ISR), Menelaos Prokos (GRC), Keng-Sam Chane Chick Té (REU), Peter Nordstrand (SWE), Daniel Renwick (AUS/EST), Rod Ben Zeev (ISR/NDL) and Kevin Scott (USA).</p></div></div></div></div></body></html>
