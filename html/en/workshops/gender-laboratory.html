As we progress in time, we start breaking these patterns. But they are more profound than we think.<br> In order to break them completely, we must know the history of gender roles and challenge ourselves not to take these things we were raised on for granted. This workshop is a laboratory for exactly that.<br> We will dive into Gender Theory and History before challenging ourselves to play the opposite sex on stage without judgment. We will then challenge ourselves to play scenes without ANY gender presumptions at all.<br> This is a laboratory that can make us see the world through different gender glasses.<br><br></p><p>Perfect for: intermediate, advanced and professional improvisers.</p><p>NB! The workshop will be held for equal amount of men and women.</p><hr><p>Hila Di Castro has been teaching theater for the past ten years and improv for the past seven.
