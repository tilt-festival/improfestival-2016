But a truly comic scene that really resonates and allows for laughs to build throughout a scene takes an understanding of comedic structures. Keeping scenes funny and the audience interested means improvising with structure and concepts towards a comedic story. Kevin Scott will introduce you to the comic devices that will make you go beyond your usual comic premises towards hilarious scenes and continuous comedy. The goal of the course is to provide a common language for improvisers to reference off stage and to follow while playing onstage. Going beyond funny characters and dialog towards funny scenes. Learning these comic devices will help improvisors go beyond the usual comic premises, sometimes referred to as the ‘game’ of the scene or the ‘comic engine’. This workshop introduces players comic devices they may not have recognized before and gives a name to ones they may already know. Concepts include: Basic scene structure, fish out of water, simple but impossible task, collision of opposites, substitution, center and eccentrics and more.<br><br></p><p>Perfect for: beginning, intermediate and advanced improvisers.</p><hr><p>Kevin Scott began teaching improvisation for the world famous Second City in Chicago in the 1990s.
