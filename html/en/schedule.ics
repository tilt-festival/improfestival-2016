SUMMARY:Do-It-Yourself
DESCRIPTION:“You gotta prepare a great party, before you invite your friends!”First step when you improvise is to build up the courage and jump on an empty stage. You got that and it feels good. Many improvisers at that moment though, feel the need to have someone with them on stage. It’s the fear of not being able to handle that scary big-ol’ stage all by themselves. They anxiously wait for someone, they call for mom, they pick up the phone and make a call… Welcoming someone else on stage is one thing. Desperately needing them is another.This workshop will show you how to take care of yourself on stage when you’re all by yourself. It’ll help you enjoy every single moment and find inspiration from the nothing, regardless of another player joins you or not.Perfect for: beginning and intermediate improvisers and goats. Goats have a lot to teach us.After having lived in Austin, Texas for a number of years, Menelaos moved back to Greece where he founded ImproVIBE, Greece’s first and only Improv training center. It has been running for 4 years now and he takes students there through their complete training, from baby steps all the way to them producing a full-blown narrative.He travels often outside of Athens to teach subject specific workshops, and/or corporate workshops and has taught some of his workshops in Belgium and Turkey.The stage elements Menelaos mostly focuses on are not relying on words, being able to handle the stage all by yourself, and finding inspiration that truly pleases you at all cost.Menelaos has also been performing on a weekly basis with Bus Kai, his two-person troupe for the past 3 years non-stop (also internationally), and with a 6-member team for the past year. He has also taken clowning workshops and method acting.  facebook.com/mene.prok

SUMMARY:Silence Is Golden
DESCRIPTION:“You say so much, when you say nothing at all.”Most of the time we use too much words when improvising. This workshop concentrates on creating and maintaining a deep and meaningful relationship between improvisers mostly without verbal connection. We will work on the intention over words and examine how this will give the audience the chance to be active members of storytelling. The more you give the more you get and by devoting to this work you will get a feel of how and why to use less words.Perfect for: beginning, intermediate and advanced improvisers.Kaisa has 12 years of experience in improvisational theater.

SUMMARY:Improv musical
DESCRIPTION:Heartbreaking topics and dramatic moments. These are the songs you can’t download from anywhere..Eesti Improteater will step in front of the audience in a demanding genre that combines improvising in theatre and music. There are three-four professional singers among them and two amateur soloists so they are in competition even with each other for who sings the best song. The most important choices will still be left for the audience - whose turn it is to make a solo appearance with a song or which topic deserves most to be explored in this attractive genre.

SUMMARY:Stockholm Syndrome
DESCRIPTION:Unpretentious entertainment for childish adults.Scent ID, from Sweden, performs a show that is all about human relationships. Whether dysfunctional, functional, neurotic, or erotic, the show is usually funny, occasionally serious, and always entertaining. The ensemble makes a point of hanging out with the audience before shows, talking to them, asking questions, chatting. Sometimes they offer sweets as an icebreaker. They use this interaction instead of the usual audience suggestions as inspiration for their show.Cast: Kristin Augutis, Daniel Malmqvist, Peter Nordstrand, and maybe a guest.This Swedish trio of fun loving actors are travelling together to get inspired by the world of improvisation. Maybe, if they are lucky, someone will get a little bit inspired by them.  facebook.com/scenkonstakademin

SUMMARY:We Don't Need No Language
DESCRIPTION:We don’t need no words to talk.Language of improv is universal. No matter where we come from or how we we’re trained, we know about failing, being positive, connecting with our partners. The more we’ve internalised these concepts, the easier it becomes to step on stage with someone we’ve never met before. The language of improv is universal - our native languages, however, are not. Even though we have so many ways of navigating a scene, we still tend to use words as our number one tool. Time to make some changes!In this workshop, Keng-Sam Chane Chick Té will introduce you to some of the core principles of Commedia del Arte in order to bring more physicality into our performances. We will look at how movement and facial expression can add value to our scenework. We will play around with language and experience how we can push a story forward by only speaking Gibberish. We will stop intellectualizing and start exploring another facet of our universal language: no language at all!Perfect for: beginning, intermediate and advanced improvisers.Keng-Sam has been learning improvisation for more than 15 years and teaching it for 10 years. He has worked with Papy aka Alain Degois, an improv master in France, Jason Geary, Rama Nicholas, Amy Moule from Australia, Nadine Antler from Germany, but also Fabio Maccioni from Italy, and a lot of other fellow teachers. He has worked and taught in many different countries (France, Australia, South Africa, Spain and the States) either in festivals or with teams of improvisation.After doing some travelling throughout the world, he decided to run his own international improv festival back home, called FERIIR. It has been running for 4 years now and they have hosted improvisers from around the globe (South Africa, Argentina, Canada, Spain, France, etc.). He also runs an improv company called “La Bagasse”.  facebook.com/pages/Les-Mardis-de-LImpro/144948022220741  theatreunion.re/11_programmation/fiche.php?num=139

SUMMARY:Off Balance
DESCRIPTION:“Come throw us off balance!” Off Balance is a fascinating long-form show that gives the audience a possibility to challenge performers on stage! In the beginning of the show the performers generate a title for their play together with the audience. Five audience members are then randomly selected and receive a coloured pillow which they can throw on the stage whenever they want (but only once) during the play. These pillows will influence the current scene significantly making the actors change the pace of the story. Come see - if you can throw them off balance!Trickle Improv is a Belgian theatre duo, that brings improvised plays to the stage, usually with an unknown guest performer. The company was founded in 2013 and an endless series of bi-weekly performances across multiple theatres in Belgium started soon after. With shows in Dutch and English Trickle uniquely appeals to a larger audience community in Belgium.Unique is that for every single show, they invite a brand new guest performer. Their guest list has quickly encompassed prominent members of the Belgian, Dutch, and later the wider European improv community and it hasn’t taken long for them to partake also in the European improv festivals as teachers and performers.  trickle-improv.com  facebook.com/trickleimprov

SUMMARY:Gender Laboratory
DESCRIPTION:On stage we can be anyone - thinking out of the gender box.Research shows that an average woman speaks about 20,000 words a day, while a man speaks only 7000.Since childhood, we are programmed by society to think of gender in a certain way - boys should wear blue and be powerful, while girls should wear pink and be gentle. As we progress in time, we start breaking these patterns. But they are more profound than we think.In order to break them completely, we must know the history of gender roles and challenge ourselves not to take these things we were raised on for granted. This workshop is a laboratory for exactly that.We will dive into Gender Theory and History before challenging ourselves to play the opposite sex on stage without judgment. We will then challenge ourselves to play scenes without ANY gender presumptions at all.This is a laboratory that can make us see the world through different gender glasses.Perfect for: intermediate, advanced and professional improvisers.NB! The workshop will be held for equal amount of men and women.Hila Di Castro has been teaching theater for the past ten years and improv for the past seven.

SUMMARY:Comic Devices
DESCRIPTION:An understanding of comedy will allow you to play more and think less.Getting the quick laugh from the audience is easy – we can always make a funny reference, a quick joke or play the wacky character. But a truly comic scene that really resonates and allows for laughs to build throughout a scene takes an understanding of comedic structures. Keeping scenes funny and the audience interested means improvising with structure and concepts towards a comedic story. Kevin Scott will introduce you to the comic devices that will make you go beyond your usual comic premises towards hilarious scenes and continuous comedy. The goal of the course is to provide a common language for improvisers to reference off stage and to follow while playing onstage. Going beyond funny characters and dialog towards funny scenes. Learning these comic devices will help improvisors go beyond the usual comic premises, sometimes referred to as the ‘game’ of the scene or the ‘comic engine’. This workshop introduces players comic devices they may not have recognized before and gives a name to ones they may already know. Concepts include: Basic scene structure, fish out of water, simple but impossible task, collision of opposites, substitution, center and eccentrics and more.Perfect for: beginning, intermediate and advanced improvisers.Kevin Scott began teaching improvisation for the world famous Second City in Chicago in the 1990s. He’s taught continuously since then for the Second City, Gotham City Improv, The People’s Improv Theater and for various other groups and organizations.

DESCRIPTION:Life before death.Improv theatre IMPEERIUM brings on stage a full-length improvised narrative in the form of comedy and drama.

Even though IMPEERIUM is still young, its actors already have seven years of experience with improv. The members of the group are all professional actors, who in addition to being members of IMPEERIUM, are also part of drama troups in other Estonian theatres or work as freelancers in various theater, television and film projects. In addition to actors, there are also talented musicians and lightning designers in the group, who all help to spread love for improv all across Estonia.The Imperials entertain audience with two-act performances, create excitement at preordered shows and arise fantasy in improv workshops. In improv nobody knows what is going to happen, but everything is possible! And that is one of the reasons why the group loves improv in all it’s shapes and forms.   improimpeerium.ee  facebook.com/improimpeerium  instagram.com/improteater_impeerium
