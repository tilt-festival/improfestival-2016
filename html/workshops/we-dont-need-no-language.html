No matter where we come from or how we we’re trained, we know about failing, being positive, connecting with our partners. The more we’ve internalised these concepts, the easier it becomes to step on stage with someone we’ve never met before. The language of improv is universal - our native languages, however, are not. Even though we have so many ways of navigating a scene, we still tend to use words as our number one tool. Time to make some changes!<br> In this workshop, Keng-Sam Chane Chick Té will introduce you to some of the core principles of Commedia del Arte in order to bring more physicality into our performances. We will look at how movement and facial expression can add value to our scenework. We will play around with language and experience how we can push a story forward by only speaking Gibberish. We will stop intellectualizing and start exploring another facet of our universal language: no language at all!<br><br></p><p>Perfect for: beginning, intermediate and advanced improvisers.</p><hr><p>Keng-Sam has been learning improvisation for more than 15 years and teaching it for 10 years. He has worked with Papy aka Alain Degois, an improv master in France, Jason Geary, Rama Nicholas, Amy Moule from Australia, Nadine Antler from Germany, but also Fabio Maccioni from Italy, and a lot of other fellow teachers. He has worked and taught in many different countries (France, Australia, South Africa, Spain and the States) either in festivals or with teams of improvisation.<br> After doing some travelling throughout the world, he decided to run his own international improv festival back home, called FERIIR. It has been running for 4 years now and they have hosted improvisers from around the globe (South Africa, Argentina, Canada, Spain, France, etc.). He also runs an improv company called “La Bagasse”.<br></p><ul><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Les-Mardis-de-LImpro/144948022220741" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">facebook.com/pages/Les-Mardis-de-LImpro/144948022220741</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theatreunion.re/11_programmation/fiche.php?num=139" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">theatreunion.re/11_programmation/fiche.php?num=139</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></body></html>
